# Space Rocket Game using C++ OpenGL

This C++ OpenGL project is a space rocket game featuring the following exciting features:

1. **Asteroid Generation**: In each gameplay, 25 asteroids are generated at random X positions and start falling towards the space rocket.

2. **Colorful Asteroids**: Each asteroid is assigned a random color: red, green, or blue.

3. **Intuitive Rocket Control**: The user can effortlessly move the space rocket using the mouse without dragging.

4. **Dynamic Laser Beam**: A colored laser beam (red, green, or blue) shoots out from the rocket. The user can change the color of the beam using the "Spacebar" key.

5. **Asteroid Destruction**: The user can destroy asteroids by aligning the laser beam with an asteroid and selecting the same color as the asteroid.

6. **Scoring Mechanism**: When an asteroid is successfully destroyed, the user's score increases by one point.

7. **Time Limit**: The game imposes a time limit of 20 seconds. Once the time is up, the "Time's Up" screen is displayed, showing the user's final score.

8. **Restart Functionality**: The user can press the "DEL" key to restart the game. Upon restart, the asteroids' X values are randomly generated again, ensuring a fresh and engaging gameplay experience.

## Prerequisites

To run this game, you need to have the following installed on your machine:
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- OpenGL library

## Usage

1. Download the source code files and compile them using a C++ compiler with OpenGL support.
2. Run the compiled executable to start the game.
3. Use the mouse to control the space rocket's movement.
4. Press the "Spacebar" to change the color of the laser beam.
5. Align the laser beam with the asteroids and select the corresponding color to destroy them.
6. Score points by successfully destroying asteroids before the time runs out.
7. Press "F1" to restart the game and enjoy a new set of randomly generated asteroids.
